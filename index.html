                <p> I am an MEng student at the <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department</a> of <a href="http://mit.edu">MIT</a>. I work in the <a href="http://ccg.csail.mit.edu">Computational Connectomics Group</a> with <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/shanir/">Prof. Nir Shavit</a>. My reseach interests are concurrent algorithms and data structures, and their applications in computational neuroscience. </p>
<p> I have received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from MIT in 2016. As an undergraduate student I have interned at Google and D.E. Shaw & Co. and did undergraduate research in my current (computational connectomics) group. </p>

    <p>
    Currently, I work on concurrent data structures that can be used to store and efficiently query large amounts of connectivity data harvested from mouse cortex.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have worked in <a href="http://ccg.csail.mit.edu">Computational Connectomics Group</a> on developing a high-throughput connectomics pipeline.
    My project was called Big Data Agglomeration for Connectomics (see <a href="/assets/files/big-data-agg-poster.pdf">poster</a>),
    for which I received the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/urop/options/awards.html#pogosyants">Anna Poghosyats UROP Award</a>.
    My research was supported by Landsman Undergraduate Research and Innovation Fund.

    <p>
    I have taken the following advanced or graduate level courses at MIT:</br>
    6.836 - Multicore Programming </br>
    6.851 - Distributed Algorithms </br>
    6.824 - Distributed Systems </br>

    </p>
    <p>
    In my 3rd undergraduate year I did the wonderful <a href="https://gecd.mit.edu/go-abroad/study-abroad/mit-study-abroad-programs/cambridge-mit-exchange-cme">Cambridge-MIT exchange</a> program, and studied Part II Mathemtaics there. I took</br>
    Graph Theory</br>
    Set Theory and Logic</br>
    Coding and Cryptography</br>
    Number Theory</br>
    Mathematical Biology</br>
    </p>

    <p>
    One of my main interests is teaching.
    I have participated in two <a href="http://misti.mit.edu/global-teaching-labs">Global Teaching Labs programs</a>: in Italy and in Armenia.
    Members of MIT Armenian Society, including myself, have played an active role in <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/misti-global-teaching-labs-launches-armenia-pilot-program-1123">initiating the program in 2015</a>.
    So far we have successfully, completed two GTL Armenia Programs.
    </p>

    <p>
    My brother and I work work on making short educational videos for school students that teach how to use computation in a variety of problems, such as modelling planet movement.
    See the <a href="https://cs4hs-am.github.io">website</a> (in Armenian).
    </p>

    <p>
    Prior to MIT, I have trained the Armenian national team for International Olympiad in Informatics and was the deputy leader of the team in IOI 2011 in Thailand.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am also a passionate hiker (or hayker), and love wandering in <a href="/assets/img/geghama.jpg">Armenian mountains</a>.
    My other hobbies include playing the flute and playing racket sports.
